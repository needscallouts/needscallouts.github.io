                <p class="lead">
                    When logged into the game, there are a few ways to join the Free Company.  The easiest
                    way would be to use the in-game <b>Player Search</b> and search for any Free Company 
                    member.  When you have located one, you can right-click on their name (square button on Playstation controller),
                    and choose <b>View Company Info</b>, the click the <b>Submit Application</b> button.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    An alternative method is to come visit our estate, located in <b>The Mist, Ward 11, Plot 30</b>. 
                    Once at the estate, you can click the <b>placard</b>, then click the <b>small search icon button</b> to
                    display the Free Company info.  From there, you can click the <b>Submit Application</b> button as usual.
